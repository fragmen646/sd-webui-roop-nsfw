## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

+ (For Windows Users) Install **Visual Studio 2022** (Community version, for example - you need this step to build some of dependencies):
  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
  OR only **VS C++ Build Tools** (if you don't need the whole Visual Studio) and select "Desktop Development with C++" under "Workloads -> Desktop & Mobile":
  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
+ In web-ui, go to the "Extensions" tab and use this URL `https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-roop-nsfw` in the "Install from URL" tab.
+ Go to the "Installed" tab and click "Restart the UI"

## Usage

1. Under "NSFW-Roop" drop-down menu, import an image containing a face.
2. Turn on the "Enable" checkbox
3. That's it, now the generated result will have the face you selected

### The result face is blurry
Use the "Restore Face" option. You can also try the "Upscaler" option or for more finer control, use an upscaler from the "Extras" tab.
You can also set the postproduction order (from 0.1.0 version):

*The old logic was the opposite (Upscale -> then Restore), resulting in worse face quality (and big texture differences) after upscaling.* 

### There are multiple faces in result
Select the face numbers you wish to swap using the "Comma separated face number(s)" option for swap-source and result images. You can use different index order.

### ~~The result is totally black~~
~~This means roop detected that your image is NSFW.~~

<img src="example/IamSFW.jpg" alt="IamSFW" width="50%"/>

### Img2Img

You can choose to activate the swap on the source image or on the generated image, or on both using the checkboxes. Activating on source image allows you to start from a given base and apply the diffusion process to it.

Inpainting should work but only the masked part will be swapped.
